Animals may bite in self-defence, in an attempt to prey on food, and as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Biting is an act that occurs when an animal uses its teeth to pierce another object, including food, flesh, and inanimate matter. A person bitten by an animal potentially carrying parvovirus or rabies virus should consult a physician immediately. Those who have been bitten by an animal may also develop bacterial infections of the bone called osteomyelitis which can become life-threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has parvovirus or rabies virus.<br><br>■Signs and symptoms<br>Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms<br>[[Impala killed and skinned by leopard bites]]<br>・Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching<br>・Serious hemorrhage if major blood vessels are pierced<br>・Infection by bacteria or other pathogens, including rabies<br>・Introduction of venom into the wound by venomous animals such as some snakes<br>・Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing inflammation and itching<br><br>■Causes<br>[[(Fig.)A mosquito bite]]<br>Bites are usually classified by the type of creature causing the wound.Many different creatures are known to bite humans.<br><br>□Vertebrates<br>・Dog bites are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.(<span class="ebsp">[1]</span><span class="ebsp">web: Dog Bite Statistics http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html </span>) About 4.7 million dog bites are reported annually in the United States.(<span class="ebsp">[2]</span>[Questions and Answers about Dog Bites<span class="ebsp"> http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span>)<br>・Other companion animals, including cats, ferrets, and parrots, may bite humans.<br>・Wildlife may sometimes bite humans.

Animals may bite in self-defence, in an attempt to prey on food, and as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Biting is an act that occurs when an animal uses its teeth to pierce another object, including food, flesh, and inanimate matter. A person bitten by an animal potentially carrying parvovirus or rabies virus should consult a physician immediately. Those who have been bitten by an animal may also develop bacterial infections of the bone called osteomyelitis which can become life-threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has parvovirus or rabies virus.<br><br>■Signs and symptoms<br>Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms<br>[[Impala killed and skinned by leopard bites]]<br>・Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching<br>・Serious hemorrhage if major blood vessels are pierced<br>・Infection by bacteria or other pathogens, including rabies<br>・Introduction of venom into the wound by venomous animals such as some snakes<br>・Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing inflammation and itching<br><br>■Causes<br>[[(Fig.)A mosquito bite]]<br>Bites are usually classified by the type of creature causing the wound.Many different creatures are known to bite humans.<br><br>□Vertebrates<br>・Dog bites are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.(<span class="ebsp">[1]</span><span class="ebsp">web: Dog Bite Statistics http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html </span>) About 4.7 million dog bites are reported annually in the United States.(<span class="ebsp">[2]</span>[Questions and Answers about Dog Bites<span class="ebsp"> http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span>)<br>・Other companion animals, including cats, ferrets, and parrots, may bite humans.<br>・Wildlife may sometimes bite humans.

He became concerned about the marketing of NLP as a tool for &quot;power enhancement&quot;, left his association with Grinder, and &quot;began to study the works of Milton Erickson M.D., Virginia Satir, and Gregory Bateson, on which NLP is based.&quot;  His studies gave him the basis for the development of his theories on mind control.(<span class="ebsp">[8]</span>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves, Ch. 2, Steven Hassan, FOM Press, 2000)<br>Hassan continued to study hypnosis and is a member of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and The International Society of Hypnosis.(<span class="ebsp">[9]</span>[<span class="ebsp"> http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/books/rtb3.htm </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span> These organizations require that their members have professional credentials and make sure they have proper training and operate within ethical guidelines.

Animals may bite in self-defence, in an attempt to prey on food, and as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Biting is an act that occurs when an animal uses its teeth to pierce another object, including food, flesh, and inanimate matter. A person bitten by an animal potentially carrying parvovirus or rabies virus should consult a physician immediately. Those who have been bitten by an animal may also develop bacterial infections of the bone called osteomyelitis which can become life-threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has parvovirus or rabies virus.<br><br>■Signs and symptoms<br>Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms<br>[[Impala killed and skinned by leopard bites]]<br>・Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching<br>・Serious hemorrhage if major blood vessels are pierced<br>・Infection by bacteria or other pathogens, including rabies<br>・Introduction of venom into the wound by venomous animals such as some snakes<br>・Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing inflammation and itching<br><br>■Causes<br>[[(Fig.)A mosquito bite]]<br>Bites are usually classified by the type of creature causing the wound.Many different creatures are known to bite humans.<br><br>□Vertebrates<br>・Dog bites are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.(<span class="ebsp">[1]</span><span class="ebsp">web: Dog Bite Statistics http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html </span>) About 4.7 million dog bites are reported annually in the United States.(<span class="ebsp">[2]</span>[Questions and Answers about Dog Bites<span class="ebsp"> http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span>)<br>・Other companion animals, including cats, ferrets, and parrots, may bite humans.<br>・Wildlife may sometimes bite humans.

He became concerned about the marketing of NLP as a tool for &quot;power enhancement&quot;, left his association with Grinder, and &quot;began to study the works of Milton Erickson M.D., Virginia Satir, and Gregory Bateson, on which NLP is based.&quot;  His studies gave him the basis for the development of his theories on mind control.(<span class="ebsp">[8]</span>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves, Ch. 2, Steven Hassan, FOM Press, 2000)<br>Hassan continued to study hypnosis and is a member of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and The International Society of Hypnosis.(<span class="ebsp">[9]</span>[<span class="ebsp"> http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/books/rtb3.htm </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span> These organizations require that their members have professional credentials and make sure they have proper training and operate within ethical guidelines.

Animals may bite in self-defence, in an attempt to prey on food, and as part of normal interactions. Other bite attacks may be apparently unprovoked. Self-inflicted bites occur in some genetic illnesses, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Biting is an act that occurs when an animal uses its teeth to pierce another object, including food, flesh, and inanimate matter. A person bitten by an animal potentially carrying parvovirus or rabies virus should consult a physician immediately. Those who have been bitten by an animal may also develop bacterial infections of the bone called osteomyelitis which can become life-threatening if untreated, whether or not the animal has parvovirus or rabies virus.<br><br>■Signs and symptoms<br>Bite wounds can cause a number of signs and symptoms<br>[[Impala killed and skinned by leopard bites]]<br>・Generalized tissue damage due to tearing and scratching<br>・Serious hemorrhage if major blood vessels are pierced<br>・Infection by bacteria or other pathogens, including rabies<br>・Introduction of venom into the wound by venomous animals such as some snakes<br>・Introduction of other irritants into the wound, causing inflammation and itching<br><br>■Causes<br>[[(Fig.)A mosquito bite]]<br>Bites are usually classified by the type of creature causing the wound.Many different creatures are known to bite humans.<br><br>□Vertebrates<br>・Dog bites are commonplace, with children the most commonly bitten and the face the most common target.(<span class="ebsp">[1]</span><span class="ebsp">web: Dog Bite Statistics http://www.dogbitelaw.com/PAGES/statistics.html </span>) About 4.7 million dog bites are reported annually in the United States.(<span class="ebsp">[2]</span>[Questions and Answers about Dog Bites<span class="ebsp"> http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/dog_care/stay_dog_bite_free/questions_and_answers_about_dog_bites/ </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span>)<br>・Other companion animals, including cats, ferrets, and parrots, may bite humans.<br>・Wildlife may sometimes bite humans.

He describes what he terms as his &quot;recruitment&quot; in his first book, Combatting Cult Mind Control,  asserting that this recruitment was the result of the unethical use of powerful psychological influence techniques by members of the Church.(<span class="ebsp">[5]</span>Combatting Cult Mind Control, Steven Hassan, 1998, Ch. 1, ISBN 0-89281-243-5)  He subsequently spent over two years recruiting and indoctrinating new members, as well as performing fundraising and campaigning duties, and ultimately rose to the rank of Assistant Director of the Unification Church at its National Headquarters.  In that capacity he met personally with Sun Myung Moon.(<span class="ebsp">[6]</span>[Biography<span class="ebsp"> http://freedomofmind.com/Media/biography.php </span>] of Steven Hassan, Freedom of Mind Center)<br>Hassan has given an account of his leaving the Unification Church in his 1998 book Combatting Cult Mind Control and on his personal website.(<span class="ebsp">[7]</span>Combatting Cult Mind Control, Steven Hassan, 1998, Ch. 2, ISBN 0-89281-243-5)<br><br>■Career<br>In 1979, following the Jonestown deaths, Hassan founded a non-profit organization called &quot;Ex-Moon Inc.&quot;, whose membership consisted of over four hundred former members of the Unification Church.<span class="ebsp">(ib. &quot;bio&quot;)</span><br>According to his biography, &quot;During the 1977-78 Congressional Subcommittee Investigation into South Korean CIA activities in the United States, he consulted as an expert on the Moon organization and provided information and internal documents regarding Moon&#39;s desire to influence politics in his bid to &#39;take over the world.&#39;&quot;<span class="ebsp">(ib. &quot;bio&quot;)</span><br>Around 1980, Hassan began investigating methods of persuasion, mind control and indoctrination.

Hassan felt that this seminar gave him &quot;a handle on techniques of mind control, and how to combat them.&quot;  He spent &quot;nearly two years studying NLP with everyone involved in its formulation and presentation.&quot;  During this period, Hassan moved to Santa Cruz, California for an apprenticeship with Grinder.  He became concerned about the marketing of NLP as a tool for &quot;power enhancement&quot;, left his association with Grinder, and &quot;began to study the works of Milton Erickson M.D., Virginia Satir, and Gregory Bateson, on which NLP is based.&quot;  His studies gave him the basis for the development of his theories on mind control.(<span class="ebsp">[8]</span>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves, Ch. 2, Steven Hassan, FOM Press, 2000)<br>Hassan continued to study hypnosis and is a member of the American Society for Clinical Hypnosis and The International Society of Hypnosis.(<span class="ebsp">[9]</span>[<span class="ebsp"> http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/books/rtb3.htm </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span> These organizations require that their members have professional credentials and make sure they have proper training and operate within ethical guidelines.

This non-coercive, completely legal approach is far better than deprogramming, and even exit counseling&quot;.(<span class="ebsp">[17]</span>[<span class="ebsp"> http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/books/rtb3.htm </span>]<span class="ebsp">[リンク切れ]</span>)<br>In his third and most recent book, Freedom of Mind: Helping Loved Ones Leave Controlling People, Cults, and Beliefs (2012), Hassan demonstrates how his approach has evolved over the last 13 years and offers a more extensive bibliography.
